Born and raised in the bustling heart of Los Angeles, Kenrick's fascination with basketball began at a tender age.

On the basketball court, Yeh made a name for himself as a star player for the UCR Highlanders. His skills, particularly his three-point shooting and ball-handling ability, left opponents in awe.
